## Overview

I'm learning web developing from last year september and i find it really exciting to do and learn so many new concepts every day. I feel like i got another chance
from life to do things right, that's why i'm very commited to learn how to program and design websites, programs, systems or other types of software. For this first i need to
master HTML and CSS, so here I am doing and practicing. Thanks to all web developing community for chances to learn from them and that they put their time to create such 
exercices!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

First things first - i deployed HTML file and grouped all elements which i was going to style with CSS
Next step for me was to put global styling so which elements would be same in desktop and mobile version
Later i started to work my way on mobile devices and i wen't from top to bottom to make each element as close to project as i could
It's not perfect and i'm happy to get feedback how could i get everything 100% right, but i'm not being to hard on myself as i'm quite new to this.
Last step was to make it happen for desktop version and see if i didn't break something in mobile version and oh boy it did make me question everything i know
about CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've learned about :
  @media (max-width: 40rem) {
  }
Now i understand more how to design website's not only for desktop version but for mobile different sizes as well and it will help for sure to spend less time on hardcoding for many device sizes.

### Continued development

I want to improve usage of a fixed sizes. As seen in the code i still use a lot of px, rem
I still strugle with margin elements perfectly as they should be,
i couldn't get again font-family right and it's different from the project form
but overall i will keep on practicing and maybe one day i can be faster than Kevin Powell or 
web dev simplified and fight with them on https://cssbattle.dev

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://flexboxfroggy.com/#pl) - This helped me as i trained how to position elements on a html
- [Example resource 2](https://learnhtmlcss.online/) - I bought this course from a dutch Jad Joubran. It's very helpful course as it's very interactive and knowledge is practice straight after reading about special element.
- [Example resource  3](https://www.toptal.com/project-managers/tomato-timer) - I'm using system of 25 minutes of hard focus and 3-5 minutes break for juggling or stratching
